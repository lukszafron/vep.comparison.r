# $${\color{lightgreen}Vep.comparison.r}$$

This R script was developed to extend the possibilities of the ENSEMBL Variant Effect Predictor app. In combination with the vep.r, it offers the ability to identify genetic variants with a high or moderate impact on the structure/function of the corresponding proteins. The results are supplemented with detailed statistical analyses followed by the visualization of the results, allowing for the determination of genes that are characterized by a higher frequency of genetic alterations in some groups of samples compared to others.

This program requires eight arguments.

                                  The first one is the path to a folder where the results generated by the vep.r script are stored, i.e, the folder containing SNP and NON_SNP subfolders,
                                  the second is the number of threads to use,
                                  the third should point to the CSV file used in the vep.r analysis,
                                  the fourth is the grouping variable,
                                  the fifth is the independent factor used,
                                  the sixth determines if the samples are paired,
                                  the seventh indicates the pair indicator column,
                                  while the eighth determines whether the FDR correction should be performed.
